# San Francisco Crime Classification (Kaggle) using Spark and logistic regression

# Overview
The "San Francisco Crime Classification" challenge, is a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) competition aimed to predict the category of the crimes that occurred in the city, given the time and location of the incident.

In this post, I explain and outline my second solution to this challenge. This time
using Spark and Python.

## Learning method

The algorithm chosen for the implemented solution, is a [multinomial logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression), a classification model based on regression where the dependent variable (what we want to predict) is categorical (opposite of continuous).
